<section>
<h1 id="introduction">SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION </h1>

This section contains summary information about this project, the user expectations and tools used in building this solution. 

Script Spartans is an interactive web-based game that combines "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" with celebrity elements, featuring intuitive design, dynamic dropdowns, and engaging gameplay.

<h2 id="about-the-project">About The Project</h2>

<p align="center"><a href="https://usmanbutt1.github.io/script-spartans/">SCRIPT SPARTANS GAME</a></p>

<h2 id="ux">User Experience (UX)</h2>

**SCRIPT SPARTANS GAME** combines "Rock, Paper, Scissors" with "Lizard" and "Spock," featuring celebrities from various professions. Players select a profession and a celebrity, while the computer randomly picks a celebrity. The game has up to 10 rounds where players and the computer select moves, with outcomes determined by rules like "Rock crushes Scissors" and "Spock vaporizes Rock." Results and scores are displayed with corresponding celebrity images and names.

Scoring is simple: a win adds a point, and ties result in no score change. The game ends after 10 rounds, allowing players to reset or quit. The title element dynamically cycles through "ROCK," "PAPER," "SCISSORS," "LIZARD," and "SPOCK," adding visual appeal. This twist on a classic game, enhanced by celebrity involvement, provides extra fun and excitement..

The uniqueness of this project are:

- Integration of "Lizard" and "Spock" alongside "Rock, Paper, Scissors" for expanded gameplay options.
- Inclusion of celebrities from diverse professions, adding a unique twist to the game experience.
- Dynamic cycling of title elements ("ROCK," "PAPER," "SCISSORS," "LIZARD," and "SPOCK") every three seconds for visual appeal.
- Clear and simple scoring system, with wins adding points and ties resulting in no score change.
- Option to reset or quit the game after completion, providing flexibility and ease of use for players.

<h2 id="management-and-development">Project Management and Development Approach</h2>

This project was implemented using the Agile Manifesto methodology. Below are the ways this project adhered to the 4 core values and 12 core principles of the aforementioned method:

<strong>Four Values of the Agile Manifesto:</strong>

- Vision 1: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: The Team held **8** planning sessions through **Slack huddle**, ensuring alignment with customer needs and prioritizing features through user story mapping.

**Zoom meeting with team members**
<a href="https://usmanbutt1.github.io/script-spartans/">
<img src="./assets/images/team-huddle.png" alt="Product Screenshot" width="100%" height="100%">
</a>

- Vision 2: Responding to change over following a plan: Throughout the project, the team managed (
  [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/UsmanButt1/script-spartans?)](https://github.com/UsmanButt1/script-spartans/issues) + [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/UsmanButt1/script-spartans?)](https://github.com/UsmanButt1/script-spartans/issues) ) GitHub issues, adapting to changing requirements and feedback iteratively. This included accepting modifications even when it is not in line with initial plan as long as it tends towards user satisfaction and better UX design. This is evidenced in the difference between the wireframe blueprint and the final product architecture.


- Vision 3: Working software over comprehensive documentation: Our project reflects 'Working software over comprehensive documentation' by adopting a mobile-first approach, prioritizing functional and optimized user experience over extensive documentation.

**A snapshot of the Kanban Board**
<a href="https://usmanbutt1.github.io/script-spartans/">
<img src="./assets/images/kanban-board.png" alt="Product Screenshot" width="100%" height="100%">

<img src="./assets/images/lighthouse.png" alt="Light House Report" width="900" height="100%">
</p>

<h2 id="bugs-and-issues">Bugs and Issues</h2>

- We encountered a bug where the buttons were non-selective, which we resolved by inspecting and adjusting the HTML and JavaScript.

- We had an issue with initial images not displaying. We fixed this by setting the default images for the Player and Computer to the Spartan head logo.

- We decided against arranging the RPSLS images in a Pentagon shape as per the wireframe due to UX design considerations.

- When a game selection is clicked, the result box failed to turn red when the Player loses and green when the Player wins. We resolved this by updating the js code to change the result box color to red for a Player loss and green for a Player win using the default color to target each output.

- Player score was not updating even when the computer score is updating correctly. We investigated and resolved the issue in the JavaScript code to ensure the player score is updated correctly.
